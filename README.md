## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Divyash24/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-ml
2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt



3. Run the application:

   streamlit run app.py


📊 ## Dataset

The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical records such as:

Glucose level

Blood pressure

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Age

Insulin level

Number of pregnancies

These features help in predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes.

🌐 ## Deployment

This project can be deployed easily using Streamlit Cloud, allowing you to share the app online.
